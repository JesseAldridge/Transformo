Transformo
===========

Basic Usage:

- Paste some text into the box on the left
- Look for the tranformation you want in the middle column
- Fill out the little boxes and hit the button
- Receive tranformed text in the box on the right

Advanced Usage:

- Each .py file in the transforms dir represents one transformation
- Each .py file contains one transformation function following a certain format
- These .py files are read at runtime
- The necessary gui controls are automatically created
- So you can easily create new tranformations
